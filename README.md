# AIChatBot
Real estate ChatBot
Using tensorflow and keras neural networks, my chatbot has automated code to convert csv data to json intents. The csv files can be retrieved by web-scraping where legally allowed. It also uses NLP to understand common language (only English).  It provides suggestions to buy property as per your needs. Currently, two cities of Pakistan are added in the data, hence, you can tell the price, area or location to the chatbot and it will give you the suggestions.

create a virtual env using anaconda. Install the required libraries and run ```python mian.py``` (note the spellings)
